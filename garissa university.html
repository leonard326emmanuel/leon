        <h3>Welcome To Garissa University Project</h3>
        <img src="HTML PROJECTS/garissa2.jpg" alt="[Garissa University]">
        <p>Garissa University was completed in October 2010, for the main purpose of educating the Somalis. The school was named after <a href="poet.html">Garissa</a>, a renowned African-American poet. Somalis in the ninteeth century were very illeterate until Garissa University came into existence. Garissa University was founded in the year 2011 as a constituent of Moi University. In the year 2014, the brutal group of terrorists well known as Al-shabaab, ambushed the students of Garissa University and killed 147 innocent students. It was the saddest news to have been heard the whole of Kenyan history. Many families lost their loved ones and the Kenyan Government also lost very ambitious and industrious future civilized manpower.After the 2014 attack, the remaining students had to be enrolled/transferred to the main campus, that's Moi University in Eldoret. The Kenyan Government also had to renovate the school and make it better in terms of security. A very strong and large wall was built in order to prevent free entry of strangers into the University. Kenya Defence Forces(KDF) were also instructed to guide the University and they also make sure that no one passes the main school gate withou being properly searched. This mechanism of making sure there's high security has really helped the students in easing their minds and making sure that nothing bad happens within the University.<p/>
